# FreshList

[Go to App](https://solo-fresh-list.herokuapp.com/home)

FreshList was created to remedy the issue of wasted and expired groceries. With it you can store your various food items which are sorted chronologically by their expiration date. It also pulls from the Edamom recipe API to offer suggestions on what to cook with your ingredients, and allows you to search for any recipe that you desire. The app was created during my time at Prime Digital Academy as part of my solo project in which we were tasked with using a web app to solve a problem. I hope you enjoy using it!
